Installation
------------

Install the latest CompilerGym release using:

::

   pip install -U compiler_gym

The binary works on macOS and Linux (on Ubuntu 18.04, Fedora 28, Debian
10 or newer equivalents).

Building from Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you prefer, you may build from source. This requires a modern C++
toolchain and bazel.

macOS 
^^^^^

On macOS the required dependencies can be installed using
`homebrew <https://docs.brew.sh/Installation>`__:

.. code:: sh

   brew install bazelisk zlib
   export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/zlib/lib"
   export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/zlib/include"
   export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/zlib/lib/pkgconfig"

Now proceed to `All platforms <#all-platforms>`__ below.

Linux 
^^^^^

On debian-based linux systems, install the required toolchain using:

.. code:: sh

   sudo apt install clang libtinfo5 libjpeg-dev patchelf
   wget https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/releases/download/v1.7.5/bazelisk-linux-amd64 -O bazel
   chmod +x bazel && mkdir -p ~/.local/bin && mv -v bazel ~/.local/bin
   export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
   export CC=clang
   export CXX=clang++

All platforms 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We recommend using
`conda <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/>`__
to manage the remaining build dependencies. First create a conda
environment with the required dependencies:

::

   conda create -n compiler_gym python=3.9 cmake pandoc
   conda activate compiler_gym

Then clone the CompilerGym source code using:

::

   git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym.git
   cd CompilerGym

Install the python development dependencies using:

::

   make init

The ``make init`` target only needs to be run once on initial setup, or
when upgrading to a different CompilerGym release.

Run the test suite to confirm that everything is working:

::

   make test

To build and install the ``compiler_gym`` python package, run:

::

   make install

**NOTE:** To use the ``compiler_gym`` package that is installed by
``make install`` you must leave the root directory of this repository.
Attempting to import ``compiler_gym`` while in the root of this
repository will cause import errors.

When you are finished, you can deactivate and delete the conda
environment using:

::

   conda deactivate
   conda env remove -n compiler_gym
