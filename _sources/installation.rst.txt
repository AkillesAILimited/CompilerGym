Installation
------------

Install the latest CompilerGym release using:

::

   $ pip install compiler_gym

The binary works on macOS and Linux (on Ubuntu 18.04, Fedora 28, Debian
10 or newer equivalents).

Building from Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you prefer, you may build from source. This requires a modern C++
toolchain. On macOS you can use the system compiler. On linux, install
the required toolchain using:

::

   $ sudo apt install clang libtinfo5 patchelf
   $ export CC=clang
   $ export CXX=clang++

We recommend using
`conda <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/>`__
to manage the remaining build dependencies. First create a conda
environment with the required dependencies:

::

   $ conda create -n compiler_gym python=3.8 bazel=3.1.0 cmake pandoc
   $ conda activate compiler_gym

Then clone the CompilerGym source code using:

::

   $ git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym.git
   $ cd CompilerGym

Install the python development dependencies using:

::

   $ make init

Then run the test suite to confirm that everything is working:

::

   $ make test

To build and install the python package, run:

::

   $ make install

**NOTE:** To use the python code that is installed by ``make install``
you must leave the root directory of this repository. Attempting to
import ``compiler_gym`` while in the root of this repository will cause
import errors.

When you are finished, you can deactivate and delete the conda
environment using:

::

   $ conda deactivate
   $ conda env remove -n compiler_gym
